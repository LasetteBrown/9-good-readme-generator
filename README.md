# Good README Generator

## Description
        
Every coder needs a good readme to explain their project. However, they can be time consuming and often repetitive. This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file. It is meant to be used in the terminal to generate a readme for your project.

## Usage
        
This product can be used to generate a generic README file. To do so, after you have installed what you need, simply type ‘node index.js’ into the terminal.The terminal will ask you questions to determine the content of your README file. Simply answer each questions and press enter to move to the next one. Once you have answered all the questions, the terminal will display ‘success’ and a new readme will be generated. Then simply move the readme to the location where it is needed.
